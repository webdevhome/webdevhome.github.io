# //webdev/home

This is a collection of links I as a web developer use very frequently. Maybe you will find them useful, too.

Link: [webdevhome.github.io](https://webdevhome.github.io)

**Planned Features:**

- Filter links by typing their name and open a page by pressing `[return]`
- Submit searches of supported sites from within this site (similar to Chrome's Omnibar)
